## Code conventions

- KISS: Keep It Simple Stupid. Complexity is the enemy of maintainability.
- Use explicit variable names (even if lengthy).
- Use prettifer to auto-format code.

## Development

Make sure you run `bun run build`, `bun run lint` and `bun run test` anytime you make major changes and fix issues that arise.
